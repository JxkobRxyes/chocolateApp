# chocolateApp
This was a group final project I worked on when I was in school. we came up with a fictional online store that enabled the user to customize their own chocolate bar all using C#. I contributed 25% of the project to create the functionality for the buttons on the first page including adding and removing items into the cart, changing the price once the item is either selected or removed from the cart, and wiping the cart clear including the price.
